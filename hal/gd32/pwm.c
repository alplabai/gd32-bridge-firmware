 * Every PWM rides a distinct TIMER channel's complementary output,
 * so per-channel duty cycles are fully independent.  Each channel's
 * main output (CHx) is unused on V2N -- only the complementary
 * (CHxN) pad sits on the E1M PWM connector.
 *
 * Periods are SHARED across all PWMs of the same timer (TIMER0:
 * PWM0..3; TIMER7: PWM4..7) because each TIMER has one ARR.  The
 * per-channel `bridge_hw_pwm_set` body updates the timer's ARR every
 * call -- last write wins.  In typical V2N use the host sets the
 * same period across each group so this doesn't surface. */
