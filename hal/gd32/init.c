 * GD32G5x3 backend for the bridge HAL.  Selected by setting
 * BRIDGE_HAL_BACKEND=gd32 in firmware/gd32-bridge/CMakeLists.txt.  Links
 * against the GigaDevice firmware-library wrapper at
 * vendors/gd32_firmware_library/ (git submodule pointing at
 * https://github.com/alplabai/gd32g5x3-firmware-library, a verbatim
 * mirror of GD's v1.5.0 release).
 *
 * Status (this commit):
 *   The file exists and compiles against the GigaDevice library so
 *   the `BRIDGE_HAL_BACKEND=gd32` build path is exercisable end-to-
 *   end without any peripheral I/O.  Every hook below is a STUB
 *   returning BRIDGE_HW_ERR_NOTIMPL -- identical wire behaviour to
 *   the bridge_hw_stub.c default backend, but routed through this
 *   file when `gd32` is selected so subsequent commits can replace
 *   stubs with real bodies one peripheral at a time.
 *
 * Implementation order (planned, in increasing risk):
 *
 *   1. RESET_REASON          -- DONE: RCU_RSTSCK decode + RSTFC clear.
 *   2. GPIO_READ / WRITE     -- DONE: 18-pad map (E1M IO8..IO35),

 *                               FFT) and stores the binding on both
 *                               sides; runtime FFT/FAC dispatch inside
 *                               stream_read follows in a later commit.
 *
 * Each follow-up commit replaces ONE hook's stub body with a real
 * implementation and updates this header comment + the CHANGELOG.
 * The HIL turn-on cadence is determined by maintainer access to the
 * V2N EVK; the structural skeleton landing today lets the rest of the
 * tree (host-side ZTESTs, the alp_*_* portable surfaces, the
 * docs/test-plan rows) gate against the real backend as soon as the
 * first hook flips from stub to real.
 *
 * Build assumptions:
 *   - arm-none-eabi-gcc on PATH (toolchain file
 *     firmware/gd32-bridge/toolchain/arm-none-eabi.cmake handles the rest).
 *   - vendors/gd32_firmware_library/upstream/ submodule initialised
 *     (`git submodule update --init --recursive` from the repo root).
 *   - Cortex-M33 + Thumb + soft-float ABI (matches the GigaDevice
 *     library's compile flags).
 *
 * Layout note (2026-06-05): this backend was split move-only into per-peripheral TUs under hal/gd32/ (fw v0.2.8 refactor); this file owns boot bring-up + board-level reads, shared tables/helpers are declared in gd32_common.h.
